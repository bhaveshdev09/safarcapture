Be it a\r\nrelaxation trip with the family, a backpacking trip with your buddies, or a solo trip. Manali has got you covered!\r\nA trip to Manali will be inadequate if you miss visiting the enthralling Solang valley, which is one of the most\r\nwidespread travel destinations of Himachal Pradesh. Solang valley is situated 14 kilometers to the northwest of\r\nManali and welcomes thousands of tourists every year. Consider as a heaven for adventure devotees, Solang\r\nvalley offers a plethora of activities like parachuting, paragliding, horse riding, Skiing, Quad biking, etc. there is a\r\nlot to explore and enjoy here in Solang valley on your Manali Trip.\r\nJispa, a beautiful little town in the Lahaul district of Himachal Pradesh, is a stunning must-visit.
